**Getting Started (Developers):**

If you're a developer interested in contributing to this project, here's how to get involved:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adityaranjan08/BankApplication.git
   ```

2. **Set up your development environment:**

   - Install required dependencies (likely mentioned in a requirements file or instructions within the code).
   * The specific technologies used will depend on whether the app is for Android or iOS:
      * **Android:** You might need tools like Android Studio, along with dependencies like Java or Kotlin for development.
      * **iOS:** Xcode would be the primary development tool, and Swift would be the programming language.

3. **Explore the codebase:** The codebase structure will likely consist of separate folders for frontend (user interface), backend (server-side logic that interacts with bank servers), and database access (if applicable).

4. **Contribute!** 
   - If you find bugs, feel free to submit bug reports.
   - If you have improvements or new features in mind, create pull requests with your contributions.

**Additional Information:**

* The readme can mention any specific technologies used for the app's backend (server-side) and database (if applicable). For example, if the backend uses Python with a Django framework and stores data in a PostgreSQL database, you can include those details.
* **Security Disclaimer:**  This application is for educational purposes only. Emphasize that real-world banking applications have robust security measures in place, and this code should not be used for any financial transactions without proper authorization and security considerations.
* Consider mentioning any third-party libraries or APIs used in the app's development.
